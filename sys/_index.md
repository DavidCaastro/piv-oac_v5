## Session Branch Protocol

**This rule applies to every agent and every provider without exception.**

The active working branch for all framework sessions is `architect`.

```
Session start:
    1. Verify current branch → git branch --show-current
    2. If not on architect → git checkout architect
    3. Proceed only after confirming branch = architect

Session end (after final commit/push):
    → git checkout architect
```

`main` is an artifact branch (product deliverables only).
Framework files (`sdk/`, `agents/`, `contracts/`, `sys/`, `git/`) live exclusively on `architect`.
Never commit framework work to `main`.

**Gitignored files** (`.env`, `logs/`, `.piv/`, `specs/active/`, `worktrees/`, `engram/` runtime)
are not managed by git. They persist in the working directory across branch switches
and are accessible from any branch without any copy or port operation.

For complete branch type definitions (Directive / Artifact) see `git/topology.md §Branch Types`.

## Routing Rule

After all BLOCKER checks in `sys/_verify.md` pass, every agent is routed to `sdk/`:

```
sdk/core/loader.py  instantiates the agent using:
  agents/<role>.md          ← role config, model assignment, phases
  contracts/<role>.md       ← role-specific PMIA contract
  contracts/_base.md        ← base protocol, gate invariants (always loaded)
```

No agent is instantiated without `contracts/_base.md`. It is mandatory for all roles.

## Load Table by Role

Agents load only what their role requires. Loading beyond this list is a context violation.

| Role | Always load | Load if condition | Never load |
|---|---|---|---|
| Master Orchestrator (L0) | `agents/orchestrator.md` `contracts/orchestrator.md` `contracts/_base.md` `git/topology.md` | `engram/core/` — only if prior session exists for this domain | Product workspace files, `engram/security/` |
| SecurityAgent (L1) | `agents/security_agent.md` `contracts/security_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` | `engram/security/` — only if prior security events exist for this domain | Product workspace files |
| AuditAgent (L1) | `agents/audit_agent.md` `contracts/audit_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` | `engram/audit/` `engram/precedents/` — only at phase exit or checkpoint write | Product workspace files |
| CoherenceAgent (L1) | `agents/coherence_agent.md` `contracts/coherence_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` | `engram/coherence/` — only when a conflict is detected | Product workspace files |
| ComplianceAgent (L1) | `agents/compliance_agent.md` `contracts/compliance_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` | `engram/compliance/` — FULL or MINIMAL scope trigger only | Product workspace files |
| EvaluationAgent (L1) | `agents/evaluation_agent.md` `contracts/evaluation_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` `metrics/schema.md` | — | Product workspace files, `engram/` |
| StandardsAgent (L1) | `agents/standards_agent.md` `contracts/standards_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` | — | Product workspace files, `engram/` |
| DocumentationAgent (L1) | `agents/documentation_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` | Active spec files from `specs/active/` | Product workspace files, `engram/` |
| ResearchOrchestrator (L1) | `agents/research_orchestrator.md` `contracts/_base.md` | `engram/core/` — epistemic gate context only | Product workspace files |
| LogisticsAgent (L1) | `agents/logistics_agent.md` `contracts/logistics_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` | — | `engram/`, product workspace files |
| ExecutionAuditor (L1) | `agents/execution_auditor.md` `contracts/execution_auditor.md` `contracts/_base.md` | — | `engram/`, product workspace files |
| Domain Orchestrator (L1.5) | `agents/domain_orchestrator.md` `contracts/domain_orchestrator.md` `contracts/_base.md` `git/topology.md` | `engram/core/` `engram/domains/<project>/` — only if prior session for this domain | `engram/security/`, product workspace files |
| Specialist Agent (L2) | `agents/specialist_agent.md` `contracts/specialist_agent.md` `contracts/_base.md` `specs/active/<task>.md` + assigned skills only | Product workspace — own task branch only | `engram/`, `sys/`, other task files |
| BiasAuditAgent (L1) | `agents/bias_auditor.md` `contracts/bias_auditor.md` `contracts/_base.md` | `specs/active/` — when auditing L2 proposals; `engram/bias/` — if prior audit events exist | Product workspace files, `engram/security/`, `Vault` |

## Load Table by Task

| Task | Load sequence |
|---|---|
| Session bootstrap | Root entrypoint → `sys/_verify.md` → `sys/_index.md` → `sdk/` |
| Gate evaluation | `contracts/_base.md` → agent-specific contract |
| Worktree operation | `sys/worktrees.md` → `sys/bootstrap.sh piv wt:*` |
| Skill loading | `skills/manifest.json` (SHA-256 verified) → `skills/<name>.md` |
| Engram write | `engram/INDEX.md` (AuditAgent only, at phase exit) |
| Engram read | `engram/INDEX.md` → agent declares atom + reason → `sdk/engram/reader.py` loads |
| Git operation | `git/topology.md` or `git/protection.md` → `sys/git.md` for connectivity rules |
| Compliance check | `contracts/compliance_agent.md` → `engram/compliance/` if triggered |
| Spec write (PHASE 0.2) | `sdk/core/spec_writer.py` → `specs/active/functional.md` + `specs/active/architecture.md` |

---

## Context Budget Rules

| Task | Read | Do NOT read |
|---|---|---|
| Implement a class | Its spec + its stub only | Other class stubs |
| Fix a bug | The buggy file + its spec | Unrelated modules |
| Add a config key | `config/settings.yaml` + relevant spec | Full codebase |
| Write tests | The spec's Testing section + the stub | Implementation details |
| Cross-module integration | Both specs + both stubs | Full directory tree |
| Gate evaluation | `contracts/_base.md` + agent contract | Everything else |

Rule: if a question can be answered from a spec or contract, do not open the `.py` file.

---

## Lazy Loading Invariant

No module is loaded speculatively. Every load must be:
1. **Declared** — the agent states which file it needs and why.
2. **Authorized** — the role's entry in the Load Table above permits it.
3. **Scoped** — the atom or file is released from context when the need is satisfied.

Loading more than declared is a context violation. `ExecutionAuditor` monitors for violations.
